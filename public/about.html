<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Chad, and I started my working career in 2007 as a welder and continued to develop and grow my technical skill over the
  following decade. In 2017 I started my journey of learning how to code and developing my online technical skill to be able  
  to work while moving and living abroad.
