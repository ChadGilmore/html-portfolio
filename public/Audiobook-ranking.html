<h1>My 3 Favorite Audio Books</h1>

<hr />
<h2>Project Hailmary by Andy Weir</h2>
<p>One of the few books out there where I would say that an audio book is the best way to read it.</p>
<h2>The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson</h2>
<p>I love Sci/fi and Fanticy books that focus on world building, and Brandon Sanderson is the best of the best.</p>
<h2>Six of Crows by Leigh Bardugo</h2>
<p>One of the first books that made me fall in love with the charecters.</p>
